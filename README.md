# HEALTHCARE_COST_CALCULATOR

The goal is to create a prediction model that, using a variety of factors, can reliably anticipate how much medical insurance premiums will cost. assisting customers in comprehending and controlling their medical costs
Goals
Gathering and preparing data

Compile thorough information from a range of sources, including medical history and lifestyle variables.
Engineering features
Create a model and test several algorithms, such as support vector regression, random forest regressor, linear regression, gradient boosting regressor, and k neighbour regressor.
Evaluation and validation of the model
Utilising relevant criteria, such as the R-squared score, evaluate the models. Average score for cross-validation
